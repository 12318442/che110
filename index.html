    <h1>Microplastics in Water</h1>

  <p>Microplastics are tiny plastic particles that are less than five millimetres (0.2 inches) in diameter. They can come from various sources, such as cosmetics, clothing, fishing nets, or the breakdown of larger plastic items. Microplastics have been found in drinking water, oceans, freshwater, and even in the air. They pose a threat to the environment and wildlife, as well as to human health. This web-site provides some information and solutions on this issue.</p>

      <p>Microplastics have been found in both tap water and bottled water. According to a research conducted in 2017, of the 159 samples collected from 14 countries, 83% were found to contain plastic particles. The US scored the highest contamination rate at 94%, while European nations had the lowest rate, still scoring a staggering 72%.</p>

      <p>Every year, more than 8 million tonnes of plastic waste enter the oceans. Microplastics, just like any other type of plastic, can take hundreds or even thousands of years to decompose. They can be ingested by marine animals, such as fish, turtles, seabirds, and whales, causing physical damage, starvation, or toxic effects.</p>

      <p>Microplastics can also be found in freshwater systems, such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands. They can enter water bodies through different pathways, such as atmospheric deposition, runoff from contaminated land, or through municipal wastewater. Microplastics can affect the aquatic organisms that live in these habitats, as well as the quality of the water resources.</p>
